      <h2>Photography 📸</h2>
        <p>
          I love photography because it is a way for me to see the world from a different perspective, to discover details that I would not have noticed otherwise, and to find beauty in even the most mundane situations. Photography also allows me to explore my creativity, to play with colors, textures and perspectives, and to create images that tell stories or moods.

      <h2>Gastronomy 👩🏻‍🍳</h2>
        <p>
         I discovered cooking at the time of confinement in 2019. Since then I have been passionate about it because it is a way for me to take care of my health and well-being, choosing fresh and nutritious ingredients, and discovering new ways to cook healthy and tasty food. It also allows me to express my creativity by combining different ingredients and exploring new flavors and textures.

      <h2>History 📜</h2>
        <p>
         I have loved history since I was a little girl because it allows me to learn about the past and better understand the world we live in today, by exploring the events, characters, and cultures that have shaped our shared history. History is also a source of inspiration and learning for me, allowing me to discover examples of courage, innovation, resilience, and leadership that can be applied to my daily life.
